Biopsies of the bronchi and carina show no evidence of malignancy, but squamous metaplasia with basal cell hyperplasia and submucosal acute and chronic inflammation were present.

Perineural invasion is present, and surgical margins are negative but very close (<1 mm) from blue-inked right margin. The tumor abuts but does not involve the bilateral strap muscles. P16 IHC status and HR HPV ISH status are pending. AJCC PATHOLOGIC TNM STAGE: pT4a pN2c pMx. In specimen G, bland appearing thyroid epithelium is present in the subcapsular sinus of two lymph nodes. No parenchymal involvement is identified, and no nuclear features of papillary thyroid carcinoma are identified. This may represent benign thyroid inclusions in lymph node - however, a metastatic carcinoma of thyroid origin cannot be excluded. Clinical evaluation and imaging of the thyroid gland is recommended."}

Comment: The tissue anterior to seminal vesicles and the right bladder margin demonstrate a small focus of crushed cells. Definitive diagnosis cannot be rendered due to hampered cytomorphology by crush artifact. The synoptic comment for prostate tumors includes the type of tumor, location, estimated volume of tumor, Gleason score, involvement of capsule, extraprostatic extension, margin status for tumor and benign prostate glands, high-grade prostatic intraepithelial neoplasia, tumor involvement of seminal vesicles, perineural infiltration, lymphovascular invasion, lymph node status, and AJCC/UICC stage. The case includes multiple specimens, including anterior prostatic fat, tissue anterior to seminal vesicles, right and left pelvic lymph nodes, and prostate with seminal vesicles. The prostate exhibits gross abnormalities such as firm yellow-tan lobulated parenchyma, a 0.5 cm tan nodule on the left anterior mid gland, and surgical clips on the right and left seminal vesicles and right lateral bladder margin. The attending pathologist made the final diagnosis based on gross and microscopic examinations, including review of all pathology slides and preliminary interpretations."}

It is identified as an expanded type AB thymoma with infiltration into the mediastinal fat (resection complete) and a central regressive alteration. There is stone-shaped cytological atypia in the lymphocyte-poor tumor sections, but the thymic tissue appears regular without thymitis. The mediastinal lymph nodes are minimally activated, not enlarged, and tumor-free. The tumor stage is Masaoka II (marginal findings). The report confirms no discrepancy between the histology on frozen and paraffin sections."}

The report details that the bladder contains a poorly differentiated predominantly solid urothelial carcinoma, which extends into the perivesical fat and shows lymphovascular invasion. The report also notes the presence of a minor degree of nodular hyperplasia in the prostate, but no evidence of microacinar adenocarcinoma. Additionally, there are metastatic urothelial carcinomas identified in the peri-bladder nodes, and in two of the six lymph nodes examined. The left ureteric margin and the right ureteric margin are both morphologically normal. The report concludes that the diagnosis is a poorly differentiated ulcerated urothelial carcinoma pT3b pN1 R0 (but close circumferential margin on the right side)."}

GROSS DESCRIPTION: The specimen is received fresh, in ten parts, each labeled with the patient's name and medical record number. Part A, \"#1. Left port site #1\", consists of a tan/white skin ellipse (4 x 1.5 cm), excised to a depth of 2 cm, with a well-healed linear scar (2 cm in length). The deep aspect of the specimen contains a firm tan tissue (2 x 1.2 x 1 cm). The outer aspect of the specimen is inked blue. Representative sections are submitted for histologic evaluation. Micro A1 and A2: 1 frag, RSS. Part B, \"#2. Left sixth rib\", consists of a single portion of tan/pink rib (13.5 x 1.4 x 0.7 cm). Bone marrow squeeze is performed. Micro B1: Bone marrow squeeze, multi frags, RSS. Part C, \"#3. 2R\", consists of two fragments of yellow/brown soft tissue (1.6 x 1.0 x 0.8 and 1.2 x 0.5 x 0.5 cm) consistent with lymph nodes. Entire specimen is submitted for histologic evaluation. Larger node is inked red and bisected prior to submitting. Micro C1: 2 lymph nodes, one inked and bisected, 3 frags, ESS. Part D, \"#4. Level 5\", consists of a single fragment of tan/anthracotic soft tissue (0.6 x 0.5 x 0.3 cm), which is entirely submitted for histologic evaluation. Micro D1: 1 frag, ESS. Part E, \"#5. Level 9\", consists of a single fragment of tan/yellow/anthracotic soft tissue (1.0 x 0.8 x 0.4 cm) consistent with a lymph node. The specimen is entirely submitted for histologic evaluation. Micro E1: 1 lymph node, 1 frag, ESS. Part F, \"#6. Level 8\", consists of a single fragment of yellow/anthracotic soft tissue (0.9 x 0.3 x 0.2 cm), which is entirely submitted for histologic evaluation. Micro F1: 1 frag, ESS. Part G, \"#7. Level 5 #2\", consists of a single fragment of yellow/brown/anthracotic soft tissue (2.0 x 1.1 x 0.6 cm) grossly consistent with one lymph node. Entire specimen is submitted for histologic evaluation. Micro G1: 1 lymph node, bisected, 2 frags, ESS. Part H, \"#8. Level 4L\", consists of a single fragment of yellow/brown soft tissue (1.5 x 1.3 x 0.9 cm) grossly consistent with two lymph nodes (ranging from 0.2 to 0.9 cm in greatest dimension). Larger lymph node is inked blue and bisected prior to submitting. Entire specimen is submitted for histologic evaluation. Micro H1: 2 lymph nodes, larger inked blue and bisected, and fibroadipose, 3 frags, ESS. Part I, \"#9. Level 10\", consists of a single fragment of tan/anthracotic soft tissue (0.9 x 0.4 x 0.3 cm) consistent with a lymph node. Entire specimen is submitted for histologic evaluation. Micro Il: 1 lymph node, 1 frag, ESS. Part J, labeled \"#10. Left pleura and diaphragm\", consists of multiple fragments of tan/pink papillary soft tissue, tan/yellow lobulated fat, and tan/red muscular soft tissue (21 x 18 x 2.8 cm; 430-gram in aggregate) with extensive firm, tan/white tumor. Representative sections of tan/pink papillary soft tissue are submitted for cytogenetics, tissue bank, and histologic evaluation. Micro J1-J3: Papillary tissue to skeletal muscle, 1 frag each, RSS. Micro J4-J8: Papillary soft tissue, 1-2 frags each, RSS. Micro J9: Yellow adipose tissue, 2 frags, RSS. By his/her signature below, the senior physician certifies that he/she personally conducted a microscopic examination (or \"gross only\" exam if so stated) of the described specimen(s) and rendered or confirmed the diagnosis(es) related thereto."}
