In specimen A, a sigmoid colon and rectum are received and show an exophytic mass located 2.3 cm from the distal margin with invasion into the muscularis propria. Thirty-two lymph nodes are identified, six of which contain metastatic adenocarcinoma. Specimens B and C consist of right and left tube and ovaries, respectively, both showing no significant pathological findings. The report concludes with a diagnosis of moderately differentiated adenocarcinoma in specimen A, with metastatic adenocarcinoma present in six of thirty-two regional lymph nodes."}

The intraoperative consultation diagnosis confirms positive carcinoma in sentinel lymph node #1 in the right axilla. The gross description summarizes the size, shape, and section details of each specimen. Immunohistochemistry confirms the presence of micrometastatic carcinoma in the sentinel lymph node. The biopsy of the second and third sentinel lymph nodes in the right axilla indicates no tumor. In the right breast mastectomy, moderate differentiated invasive ductal carcinoma is present in the upper outer quadrant measuring 1.2 cm in greatest dimension. The ductal carcinoma is also present at the anterior margin in the upper inner quadrant. The breast tissue excision indicates ductal carcinoma in situ (DCIS) present at the inked aspect. The axillary contents dissection shows no tumor in 13 lymph nodes. Oncotype DX breast cancer assay results indicate a recurrence score of 16 with a low risk of distant recurrence at 10 years. The summary concludes with the final review and addendum from the pathologists."}
